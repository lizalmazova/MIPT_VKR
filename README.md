# Using machine learning methods to assess the stability of the banking sector
## TARGET
Research and application of machine learning methods to assess the stability of the banking sector.

## PROBLEM 
The approaches presented in scientific articles and studies do not achieve high quality metrics. The data that can potentially be used to solve problems of this type is highly unbalanced, which entails a low predictive ability of the models.

## RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
1) study of the influence of methods of working with class imbalance on the effectiveness of training;
2) study and application of algorithms traditionally used in problems of forecasting the stability of the banking sector;
3) development and testing of approaches to creating ensembles of machine learning models;
4) conducting a comparative analysis of existing models and developed ensembles of models based on accuracy metrics;
